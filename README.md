In my final project, I implemented a content management system (CMS) that is adaptable to different enterprises or entities. This tool is capable of distributing various pieces of information for a wide range of purposes, allowing them to stay in contact with their clients or employees.

This content management system is not designed to solve a specific problem but rather to serve as a generic prototype to meet the needs of any client. It accomplishes this with minimal development effort, focusing on addressing the specific requirements of these clients.

The primary strength of this project lies in its generic nature, which is most evident in the back-end component. Given its crucial role, I paid careful attention to minimizing potential issues, such as an excessive number of database tables or their absence.

This application was developed to fulfill requests from clients associated with a small company named "Ingeniería SectorF8," located in "El Parque Tecnológico de Gijón." Typically, their clients, which are other companies, require a management system to oversee their news. Consequently, through this application, they can send microcontent to their employees or clients, keeping them informed about tasks, opportunities, news, and more. It also serves those who wish to engage with their clients by providing information about product offers and brand-new services.

Therefore, by implementing and utilizing this platform as a starting point for future projects, it has the potential to assist programmers in reducing development timelines and, consequently, saving the company money.

This Bachelor Thesis developed a prototype primarily using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, and PHP based on the Laravel framework.
