In my final project, I implemented a content management system (CMS) adaptable to
different enterprises or entities. This tool is able to distribute pieces of information with
many different purposes to be in touch with their clients or employees.
This content management system does not intend to solve a specific problem, but rather to
be a generic prototype to fulfil any client’s necessities. This prototype achieves so with a
minimum development focused on any specific area concerning these necessities.
The biggest strength of this project is its generic nature, which can be mostly noticed in the
back-end part. Since it is a key point, I was more meticulous to reduce to the minimum the
possibilities of having problems such as having too much database tables or lacking them.
This application was conducted to fulfil some clients’ requests from a little company called
“Ingeniería SectorF8”, established in “El Parque Tecnológico de Gijón”.
Usually, their clients, which are other companies, need a management system to supervise
their own news. Thus, by using this app, they are able to send microcontents to their
employees or clients, so that they are informed of their tasks, opportunities, news, and so on.
It also works for those willing to address the clients by informing about product offers and
brand-new services
Therefore, by implementing and using this platform as a beginning point for programmers’
future projects, it could be helpful to shorten the deadlines for development and as a
consequence, to make the company save money.
This Bachelor Thesis developed a prototype consisting mainly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
jQuery, Ajax being PHP based in the framework Laravel.
